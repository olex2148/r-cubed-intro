Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly required
of scientists and researchers. We as researchers are also facing more
challenging and complex analyses for larger and larger datasets. Nor do
we receive the necessary support and training on how to do these
analyses and apply these open and reproducible practices. This course
will introduce many of the core concepts and practices for doing
reproducible and open data analysis to get you familiar with and
prepared for the type of work needed in research now and in the future.
We use a very practical approach based largely on code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), hands-on exercises, reading
activities, and a group project. Our overarching **learning outcome** is
that at the end of the course, participants will be able to:

> Describe the fundamentals of what an open and reproducible data
> analysis looks like and then create a project that applies some of the
> basics of these concepts using R.

Our specific **learning objectives** are to:

1.  Explain what an open and reproducible data analysis workflow is,
    what it looks like, and why it is important.

2.  Explain and demonstrate why [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is
    rapidly becoming the standard program of choice for doing modern
    data analysis in science.

3.  Demonstrate and apply collaborative tools and techniques when
    working in team settings (including working with your future self).

4.  Show and apply the fundamental tools and skills for conducting a
    reproducible and modern analysis for a research project, focusing on
    the basics of wrangling and visualizing data, writing reproducible
    reports, and structuring projects.

5.  Show where to go to get help and to continue learning modern data
    analysis skills.

Because learning and coding is ultimately not *just* a solo activity, in
addition to the group project work, during this course we also aim to
provide opportunities to chat with fellow participants, learn about
their work and how they do analyses, and to build networks of support
and collaboration.

The course will place particular emphasis on research in diabetes,
health, and metabolism; it will be taught by instructors working in this
field and it will use relevant examples where possible.

The specific software and technologies we will cover in this course are
R, [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/),
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/), while the specific R packages are
`{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}` packages.

## Is this course for you? {#sec-is-it-for-you}

To help manage expectations and develop the material for this course, we
make a few assumptions about *who you are* as a participant in the
course:

-   You are a researcher, likely working in the biomedical or health
    field (ranging from experimental to epidemiology).
-   You currently or will soon do some quantitative data analysis.
-   You either:
    -   know *nothing* or *little* about R (or computing in general);
    -   *haven't* used code-based programs for doing data analysis (e.g.
        have used SPSS);
    -   *have* used coding programs before (e.g. used SAS or Stata), but
        not R;
    -   or know how to use R, but *haven't* used the
        [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) or
        [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).

While we have these assumptions to help focus the content of the course,
if you have an interest in learning R but don't fit any of the above
assumptions, *you are still welcome to attend the course*! We welcome
everyone, that is until the course capacity is reached.

In addition to the assumptions, we also have a fairly focused scope for
teaching and expectations for learning. So this may also help you decide
if this course is for you.

### We teach {.unnumbered}

-   How to use R, starting from the very basics and targeted to
    beginners.
-   Using a team science, reproducible research, and open scientific
    perspective (i.e. by including a collaborative group project that
    uses a transparent and reproducible analysis workflow).
-   Using practical, applied, and hands-on lessons and exercises, with a
    few short lectures that introduce a topic.

### We *do not* teach {.unnumbered}

-   Statistics (these are already covered by most universities).
